## Contribute

Visit [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/guizhan-translation-center) to contribute translations.

If your language is not listed on Crowdin page, or your translation is not approved for a long time, please contact me on Discord, not on Crowdin. I barely check Crowdin chat.
